# Yale Smart Alarm

Adds basic interaction with Yale Smart Alarm systems.

It is now considered stable, but please report any issues found.

## TODO
* Allow Homey to know the state of the alarm and trigger flows based on changes (would probably need to poll the alarm's API)


## Credits
This app was written entirely by me, but the following sources helped:
